## This article explores bottom-up cost estimation techniques.

Bottom-up cost estimating technique is one of the methods used to estimate software development costs.

This technique focuses on estimating the resources and time required for development, taking into account the size and complexity of a software development project.

In this article, we will look at an overview of the bottom-up cost estimation technique, the LOC (Line of Code) technique, and the staffing technique at each stage of development.

### Overview of bottom-up cost estimating techniques

Bottom-up costing is a method of estimating software development costs based on factors related to the size of the project.

This technique estimates the resources required for software development, taking into account the size, complexity, and development environment of the project.

Bottom-up cost estimating techniques initially estimate costs at a more abstract level and perform detailed cost estimates as the development process progresses.

### LOC (Line of Code) technique

The LOC technique is a method of estimating costs based on the number of lines of code involved in software development.

This technique estimates the size of a project through the amount of source code written by developers, and calculates the time and resources required for development based on this.

In general, the LOC technique predicts costs using historical project data or an estimation model based on a standardized number of lines.

### Personnel transfer technique for each stage of development

The man-month technique for each development stage is a method of dividing the development process into several stages and calculating the man-month required for each stage.

This technique breaks down the software development process into stages such as requirements analysis, design, coding, and testing, and estimates the number of man hours needed for each stage.

At this time, the number of person-months is calculated as the number of hours that one developer can work in a month.

## Conclusion

Bottom-up cost estimating techniques are a useful way to estimate software development costs.

The LOC method calculates the cost based on the amount of code written by the developer, and the number of personnel months by development stage subdivides the development process into stages to calculate the number of personnel months.

These cost estimating techniques play an important role in the efficiency and budget management of development projects.

However, cost estimation does not always guarantee accurate forecasts, so it is important to consider a variety of factors and be flexible.
