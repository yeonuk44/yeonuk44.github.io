### Background of the emergence of big data

The background of the emergence of big data was the rapid increase in the amount, variety, and speed of data, which led to the limitations of existing data processing technologies.

In addition, the spread of the Internet and mobile devices, and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) have accelerated the increase in big data.

### Metaphors related to the 3Vs (Variety, Velocity, and Scale)

- Diversity: Big data deals with various types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. This can be compared to the coexistence of various creatures in the sea.
- Velocity: Big data has the characteristic of generating and processing hundreds of thousands of pieces of data per second in real time. This can be likened to big data constantly flowing like a fast-flowing river.
- Volume: Big data has the characteristic of handling large-scale data ranging from tens of terabytes to tens of petabytes or more. This can be likened to big data containing a vast amount of data, like clouds covering an endless sky.

### Changes brought about by big data

By overcoming the limitations of existing data processing technologies and methodologies, creating new business models and innovating existing business models, the value of data has been newly recognized.

Big data analysis is used to make real-time predictions, provide personalized services, and make business decisions, and plays an important role in increasing a company's competitiveness and creating new value.

## Conclusion

Above, we learned about the background of the emergence of big data, metaphors related to the 3Vs, and the changes that big data brings.

Big data is becoming an important driver of future business and technology, redefining the value and usability of data.

thank you!
