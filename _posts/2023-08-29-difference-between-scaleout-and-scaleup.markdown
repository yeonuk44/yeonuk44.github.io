### About the difference between Scale-Out and Scale-Up

{:data-align="center"}

<!-- outline-end -->

Today, I'd like to introduce a term that I've come across while studying Infra.
When you run a server, you need a lot of server capacity and performance as your users grow or your business expands.
At this point, you may have a strategy to scale your infrastructure with the terms "scale out" and "scale up" introduced earlier.
Each of these two methods has specific advantages and disadvantages, and your use case may dictate which one you should choose.

#### First, let's talk about scale-up.

**Scale-Up**.
What it means: Scale-up is a way to upgrade the hardware of an existing system. For example, adding a higher-performance CPU, more memory, faster disks, etc.
Pros: It's a simple way to upgrade your hardware, and it's relatively easy to manage.
Cons: Because hardware has physical limits, you may not be able to scale further beyond a certain point of performance. Also, a failure of a specific part can affect the entire system.
Best for: Smaller applications or when you need high performance from a single system.

#### The following is about scale-out.

\*\*Scale-Out
What it means: Scale-out is a way to expand the performance and capacity of a system by adding new devices or nodes. Examples include clusters and distributed system structures.
Benefit: By adding more devices, you can continue to scale performance and increase the system's fault tolerance. This is because if any node fails, another node can pick up the slack.
Cons: Requires complex configuration, can be difficult to manage and maintain, and requires applications and systems to be designed to work well in a distributed environment.
Best for: Large-scale applications and services, cloud-based services, and distributed processing such as big data processing.
