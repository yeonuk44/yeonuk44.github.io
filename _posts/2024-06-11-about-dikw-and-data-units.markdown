### data unit

Data is a factual record or information that represents facts or meaning and is expressed in the form of numbers, letters, images, voices, etc.

Data is simply collected and has no meaning or value.

Examples of data include numbers measured by a temperature sensor, a customer's address, and the price of a product.

Before these data are given meaning, they are simply seen as a collection of information.

### DIKW Pyramid

- Data: Data is a factual record or form of information, and simply refers to information in a collected state. These data have no meaning in and of themselves.
- Information: The result of analyzing and interpreting data and giving it meaning is called information. Information refers to data that has been processed into a state where it can be used to support decision-making or solve problems.
- Knowledge: refers to the knowledge and ability to understand and utilize information. Knowledge is the ability to solve problems and make decisions based on information, and is formed through experience and knowledge.
- Wisdom: refers to the wisdom of how to act and make decisions through knowledge. Wisdom means using knowledge to make high-level decisions, such as predicting the future, solving complex problems, and acting ethically.

The DIKW pyramid shows how the value of data develops by explaining the process by which data leads to information, information to knowledge, and knowledge to wisdom.

## Conclusion

This is a brief look at data units.

Data is the foundation of information, through which we can gain knowledge and wisdom.

thank you!
