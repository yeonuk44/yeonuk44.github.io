### Concepts

An "access line" is a term used in computer networks to refer to the physical connection used to access network services or internet services.

It typically refers to a path or medium for transmitting data or accessing a network.

### Types of access lines

1. DSL (Digital Subscriber Line): Primarily used for residential broadband internet service, it connects to the internet via a telephone line.
2. Dedicated Line (Dedicated Line): Used when a business or organization needs higher bandwidth, it has a dedicated line for internet connection and telephone communication.
3. Fiber Optic Line: Transmits data through fiber optic cables and offers high speed and bandwidth.
4. Ethernet Line: Mainly used in local networks (LAN), it is used to connect computers or network devices to the network.

### Recap.

Access lines are typically provided through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or telecommunications company.

These lines allow individuals or businesses to access various network services, such as the Internet, phone calls, and data transfer.

It is the part of the line that connects to the provider.
