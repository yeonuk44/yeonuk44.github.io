## This is an article about code errors and Stack Guard.

hello!

Today we are going to learn about code errors and Stack Guard.

Before starting the writing in earnest,

**---Today’s TMI---**

Tonight’s dinner is ‘fried pork’! I've always been curious about how they fried pig like making chicken rather than sweet and sour pork, so I got a chance and tried it! I'm so curious! If it's delicious, I'll mention it again in the next article. lol

**---TMI End---**

Let’s get back to writing!

### Code error

Code errors are problems that occur during program execution and can appear in various forms, such as bugs, exceptions, and memory overflows.

These code errors can affect the stability and security of your program.

To prevent this, a technology called Stack Guard is used.

### Stack Guard

A stack guard is a mechanism used to protect the stack area of a program.

The stack is a memory area that stores information related to function calls and must be protected from attacks such as buffer overflow.

A stack guard stores a specific value at the end of the stack and checks this value when calling a function to detect stack overflow.

Stack guards can be implemented in a variety of ways.

The most common way is to use a stack guard page.

A stack guard page is located at the end of a memory page, and if an attempt is made to access that page during a stack overflow, an exception is raised and the program is halted.

This allows you to detect and respond to stack overflow attacks.

Stack Guard plays an important role in improving the stability and security of programs.

However, stack guards alone cannot prevent all code errors.

Therefore, in addition to stack guard, developers must use various methods such as code verification, input verification, and appropriate exception handling to prevent and handle code errors.

Additionally, stack guard may have some effect on performance.

This is because an additional inspection process is required to access the stack guard page.

However, this can be seen as an appropriate investment in terms of improving security and stability.

## Conclusion

Today we learned about code errors and Stack Guard.

Code errors affect the stability and security of a program, so it is important to prevent and handle them by leveraging protection mechanisms such as stack guards.

Developers must keep in mind that they must write secure code and pay attention to security.

thank you
