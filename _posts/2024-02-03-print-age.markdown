## This is an article looking into the “age output” problem.

As I solve coding test problems, I look back on the problems I solved and look into different solution methods to learn more.

Let's look at the problem first.

{:data-align="center"}

<!-- outline-end -->

### problem

I wondered what year the shy 40-year-old teacher was born.

When age is given, please complete the solution function that returns the year of birth based on 2022.

#### Restrictions

0 < age ≤ 120

Age is 1 year in the year of birth and increases by 1 for each year.

#### Input/Output Example

| age | result |
| --- | ------ |
| 40  | 1983   |
| 23  | 2000   |

<!-- | start_num | end_num | result |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| 10 | 3 | 0 | -->

### My solution to the problem

```java
class Solution {
     public int solution(int age) {
         int answer = 0;
         answer = 2022 - age + 1;
         return answer;
     }
}
```

### Solution explanation

Based on 2022, we wrote the code answer = 2022 - age + 1;: to reflect the fact that the age is subtracted from the value starting from 1 year old to satisfy the restrictions.
