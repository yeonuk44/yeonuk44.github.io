## This is an article about DW and Data Lake.

hello!

Today we will learn about DW and Data Lake.

### Data Lake

A data lake is a central repository that stores all types of data, both internal and external to the enterprise, and can accommodate structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

The original form of the data is preserved and stored, the data can be loaded without a schema, and the schema can be applied for analysis or use when necessary.

It mainly stores large-scale and diverse data and is used for big data analysis, machine learning, IoT data collection, and data science.

It places emphasis on data diversity, flexibility, and scalability, and has features suitable for unstructured data or real-time data analysis.

## Conclusion

This is a brief look at DW and DL.

Data warehouses are used to support stable and consistent analysis centered on structured data, and data lakes are used to accommodate various types of data to support flexible analysis and utilization.

The two data repositories are used complementary to each other for enterprise data management and utilization.

thank you!
