### Goal setting

The goals of the analysis project must be clearly set and shared and understood by the entire project team. Goals must be specific and measurable.

### Resource Planning

You must plan and secure the resources (people, equipment, budget, etc.) needed to carry out the project.

In particular, the roles and responsibilities of data engineers, analysts, business experts, etc. must be clarified.

### Schedule planning

You should plan and monitor your project's schedule in detail so that you can take action when delays or problems arise.

### Risk Management

Risks that may arise while carrying out a project must be identified in advance and countermeasures must be prepared.

Data shortages, poor quality, technical problems, etc. must be predicted in advance and prepared for.

### Communication

Project progress, issues, and changes must be properly communicated to team members and stakeholders, and communication must be facilitated.

### Quality Management

Quality control must be performed to ensure the quality of the data and the accuracy of the analysis results.

The accuracy and consistency of data must be maintained, and the validity of analysis results must be confirmed.

### Change Management

As requirements or environments may change as the project progresses, changes must be managed and responded appropriately.

### Project evaluation

Once a project is completed, its performance and processes should be evaluated to learn lessons that can be incorporated into future projects.

## Conclusion

As mentioned above, you must systematically manage your analysis project by considering these measures and continuously make efforts to achieve your goals.

thank you!
