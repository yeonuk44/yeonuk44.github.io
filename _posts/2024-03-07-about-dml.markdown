### SQL

SQL is a language for manipulating data in a database management system (DBMS), and DML is one of SQL's sublanguages.

DML is used to retrieve, insert, modify, and delete data.

Now let's learn more about DML.

### DML

DML is used to manipulate the contents of a database.

Major DML commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

You can use these commands to manipulate data and achieve desired results.

#### SELECT

SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from the database.

You can select the data you want from a specific table and filter it according to your desired conditions.

The SELECT statement is mainly used to read data from a database, and the desired information can be obtained from the results.

#### INSERT

INSERT statement is used to insert new data into the database.

You can add new records to a specific table and insert data by specifying values for each column.

You can register new information in the database by adding data using the INSERT statement.

#### UPDATE

The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in the database.

You can select the desired record from a specific table and update the value of that record.

You can update the contents of a database by modifying data using the UPDATE statement.

#### DELETE

DELETE statement is used to delete specific data from the database.

You can select and delete records that meet the desired criteria from a specific table.

You can remove unnecessary information from a database by deleting data using the DELETE statement.

DML provides powerful capabilities to manipulate the contents of a database to retrieve the data you need, insert new data, or modify and delete data.

DML allows database users to manipulate data flexibly and achieve desired results.

## summary

DML is a set of commands for retrieving, inserting, modifying, and deleting data, and plays an important role in manipulating the contents of a database.
