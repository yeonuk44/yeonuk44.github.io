## SQL (SQL) Concepts

SQL is a language for interacting with databases and is used to define, manipulate, and control data.

SQL is largely divided into Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL).

- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Used to define and manage database objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.).
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Used to retrieve, insert, modify and delete data.
- **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Used to control access to the database.

### Key Features of SQL

- **SEARCH DATA (SELECT)**: Search the database for the desired data.
- **Insert Data (INSERT)**: Inserts new data into the database.
- **UPDATE**: Modify existing data in the database.
- **Delete Data (DELETE)**: Delete data from the database.

### Types of SQL

There are various types of SQL, and the main types are as follows.

- **MySQL**: one of the most widely used open source relational database management systems (RDBMS).
- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source RDBMS with strong capabilities and scalability.
- **Oracle Database**: Commercial RDBMS used by large enterprises and institutions.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: RDBMS developed by Microsoft, widely used in Windows environments.

### Leveraging SQL

SQL is used in a variety of applications for interaction with databases.

It is mainly used for integration with databases in web applications, mobile applications, enterprise systems, etc.

## at the end of the day

SQL is an essential language for interacting with databases, providing a variety of functions for defining, manipulating, and controlling data.

Different SQL types are used in different environments based on their characteristics, which can increase the efficiency of data management and analysis.

Thank you!
