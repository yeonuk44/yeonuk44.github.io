## This article explores software development cost estimation using mathematical calculation techniques.

In this article, we will learn about Cocomo's software development types, the Putnam model, and the function point (FP) model.

### Types of software development in Cocomo

Cocomo (Model) is an abbreviation for Constructive Cost Model and is a model used to estimate software development costs.

Cocomo categorizes software development projects into three types:

**Organic**

It's suitable for relatively small and simple projects.

Applies when developers have extensive experience and a stable development environment.

This includes, for example, software development projects by individuals or small teams.

**Semi-Detached**

Suitable for slightly more complex projects.

This applies when some team members lack experience or the development environment is relatively unstable.

For example, a software development project by a medium-sized organization or team.

**Embedded**

Suitable for very complex, reliability-critical projects.

Applies when the development environment is uncertain or the developers have limited experience.

Examples include embedded systems or highly reliable software development projects.

Cocomo's software development typology helps you choose a costing model and coordinate your development process based on the characteristics of your project.

### Putnam model

The Putnam model is a model that represents the relationship between the size of a software development project and the manpower devoted to development.

This model estimates costs by analyzing the correlation between the manpower required for software development and the development period.

The Putnam model estimates the amount of manpower needed for software development based on the size of the development project.

This allows you to calculate the expected development period and cost of your project.

The Putnam model helps managers plan project schedules and manage risks.

**Function Points (FP) Model**

The function point (FP) model is a model that calculates costs based on the functional aspects of software.

This model measures function points based on the functional requirements of the software and uses this to calculate development costs.

The FP model classifies software functionality into elements such as external inputs, outputs, data files, and documented data.

Each element is weighted according to its complexity to calculate the function score.

This helps you estimate development costs and plan project schedules.

The function point model facilitates communication between developers and customers and helps effectively manage the cost and schedule of software development projects.

## Conclusion

Estimating software development costs is an important process that determines the success and efficiency of a project.

Mathematical estimation techniques are methodologies used to quantitatively estimate software development costs.
