## This is an article about regression analysis.

hello!

Today we will learn about regression analysis.

Regression analysis is a statistical method that analyzes the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used to identify correlations between data and build predictive models.

Below is information on regression analysis.

## Dependent and independent variables

### Dependent Variable

A variable that is influenced by other variables and is a variable that is intended to be predicted or explained.

### Independent Variable

A variable that affects the dependent variable and explains changes in the dependent variable.

## Types of regression analysis

### Simple Linear Regression

It is a method of analyzing the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable.

### Multiple Linear Regression

It is a method of analyzing the relationship between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable.

### Logistic Regression

This method is used for classification problems by analyzing the relationship between a binary dependent variable and an independent variable.

## Use of regression analysis

### prediction

It is used to predict future values ​​based on past data.

### Causal analysis

It is used to determine causal relationships between independent and dependent variables.

### Variable importance assessment

It is used to evaluate the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable.

## Evaluation of regression analysis

### Residual Analysis

Assess the suitability of a model by analyzing the differences between the model's predicted values ​​and actual values.

### Coefficient of determination (R-squared)

It is an indicator of how much the model explains the total variance in the dependent variable.

## Conclusion

Regression analysis is an important data analysis technique and is actively used to understand relationships between variables and build predictive models.

thank you!
