### About future types of big data

#### IoT data

Data generated from Internet of Things (IoT) devices is expected to become an important source of big data in the future.

Sensor data generated through smart cities, smart homes, industrial sensors, etc. will reach enormous scale.

#### Video and image data

The amount of video and image data continues to increase.

It is expected to be used in various fields such as extracting information from videos, object recognition, and face recognition through big data analysis.

#### Social Media and Web Data

Text, image, and video data generated on social media will also be included as part of big data.

This data is expected to be used to analyze customer insights, marketing trends, etc.

This may lead to incorrect analysis results.

#### Biological data

In the fields of life science and medicine, various biological data such as genome analysis, protein sequence analysis, and biosensor data are expected to develop as part of big data.

#### Financial and transaction data

Large-scale financial data generated from financial transactions, payments, exchanges, etc. are expected to be used as an important element of big data in the financial field.

#### Environmental and climate data

Data on climate change, environmental pollution, natural disasters, etc. are expected to form an important part of big data in the global environment and sustainability fields.

## Conclusion

Future big data includes not only existing structured data but also unstructured data and data from various sources, and the types of such data are expected to continue to diversify.
