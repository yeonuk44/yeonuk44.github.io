## This is an article about network security solutions.

hello!

Today, we will learn about Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which are important parts of network security, Virtual Private Network (VPN), and Secure Shell (SSH), which enable secure remote access. .

Before starting the writing in earnest,

**---Today’s TMI---**

The information processing technician practical exam is just around the corner!

Even though I wasn't really nervous when it came to writing, I was a little nervous when it came to practical skills haha.

Do you also have a certification that you would like to pursue?

Let's fight together!

**---TMI End---**

Let’s get back to writing!

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

An intrusion detection system is a security solution that detects and blocks unusual activity on a network or system.

This system can come in many forms and can be mainly divided into two types:

- Network-based IDS (NIDS): NIDS monitors traffic and detects abnormal behavior on the network. Packet analysis can identify unknown attacks or unauthorized access.
- Host-based IDS (HIDS): HIDS operates on a specific system and detects intrusions by monitoring logs and events occurring in that system. It can detect malware or malicious user actions.

###VPN (Virtual Private Network)

A VPN is a technology for securely transmitting data over public networks.

It provides secure connections primarily over the Internet, allowing you to communicate securely with users in remote locations or with networks located in other geographies.

- Advantages of VPN
  - Encryption: Encrypts data to prevent eavesdropping.
  - Authentication and access control: Strengthen security by authenticating users and managing access rights.
  - Remote work environment: Even users in remote areas or on the move can access a secure network.

### SSH (Secure Shell)

SSH is a protocol and application for securely connecting to remote systems.

In particular, it is used to connect to remote servers and transfer files through a text-based command line interface.

- Core features of SSH
  - Encryption: Encrypts data during communication to prevent eavesdropping.
  - Authentication: Securely authenticate users to prevent unauthorized access.
  - Port Forwarding: Allows access to various services through a secure tunnel.

## Conclusion

This concludes our brief introduction to intrusion detection systems, VPNs, and SSH.

These security solutions play a critical role in modern network environments and are essential for keeping data and systems safe.

We encourage you to actively utilize these technologies to create a safer digital environment.
