### Intelligent hyper-connected network

An intelligent hyper-connected network is a network that efficiently processes and manages data by combining artificial intelligence technology and network technology.

These hyper-connected networks enable intelligent decision-making by processing and analyzing large amounts of data in real time.

Additionally, hyper-connectivity networks provide automated network management and maintenance functions to increase the efficiency of network operations.

### Software-defined technologies

Software-defined technology is a technology that defines the functions and behavior of software by the software itself.

This increases the flexibility and scalability of the software.

Software-defined technologies include concepts such as virtualization, automation, and programmable networks, and enable efficient resource management in conjunction with cloud computing.

### IoT (Internet of Things)

IoT stands for Internet of Things, and is a technology that connects objects to the Internet by embedding sensors and communication functions in them.

Through IoT, things can connect to each other, exchange data, and sense and control the environment around us.

For example, at home, smart home devices can interact to provide convenience in life, and at industrial sites, smart factories can be implemented to improve productivity.

### IoT-related terms and concepts

- Sensor: A device that collects data from the physical environment and can measure temperature, humidity, illumination, etc.
- Actuator: A device that operates to influence the outside, including switches, motors, valves, etc.
- Smart City: A concept that improves city efficiency, safety, and convenience by applying IoT technology throughout the city.
- Things network: A network for communication between things, using wireless communication technology.

### Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a technology that requests and uses computer resources (servers, storage, software, etc.) over the Internet.

Users can flexibly use as many computing resources as needed and reduce the burden of infrastructure management and maintenance.

Cloud computing comes in the form of software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

###Zing

Zing is a real-time Java virtual machine that provides high performance, high availability, and scalability.

Zing improves software performance and reliability by providing an environment suitable for large-scale transaction processing, real-time analysis, and large memory usage.

### WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing)

WDM is a technology used in optical communications, and is a method of transmitting optical signals of multiple wavelengths through a single optical fiber.

WDM enables high-speed data communication by efficiently using the bandwidth of optical fiber.

### LOD (Linked Open Data)

LOD is a way to connect, integrate, and share data published on the web.

LOD clearly defines the meaning of data and provides interconnectivity by establishing relationships with other data.

### SSO (Single Sign-On)

SSO is an authentication method that allows users to access multiple applications with one authentication.

SSO allows users to conveniently use various applications without having to go through a separate authentication process.

### Smart Grid

Smart grid is a grid system that improves the power grid with digital and communication technology.

Smart grid monitors and adjusts power supply and demand in real time to increase power efficiency and prevent failures and overloads.

### Metaverse

Metaverse refers to a virtual space that combines virtual reality and the real world.

In Metaverse, users can engage in a variety of virtual activities and provide experiences similar to the real world.

Metaverse is actively used in areas such as virtual collaboration, virtual commerce, and virtual education.

## Conclusion

These new technologies are having a significant impact on modern society and businesses and are developing toward a better future.
