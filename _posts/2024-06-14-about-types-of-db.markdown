### Relational Database

This is the most widely used type of database in companies, storing data in table form and managing data using SQL (Structured Query Language).

Representative examples include Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, and are mainly used for storing and managing structured data.

### NoSQL Database (Not Only SQL Database)

It is a database based on a non-relational data model that supports large-scale distributed data processing and flexible data modeling.

It is used for enterprise large-scale and real-time data processing, handling various types of data such as graph, key-value, document, column-oriented, etc.

MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, etc. are representative NoSQL databases.

### Data Warehouse

It is a data repository for collecting, integrating, and analyzing various data inside and outside the company and using it for decision making.

It is used for corporate decision-making support and business intelligence, and is used to store and analyze large-scale data.

### Graph Database

It is a database specialized in handling complex connection relationships by expressing data relationships as nodes and edges.

It is used in fields such as social networks, recommendation systems, and network security, and is used in applications that emphasize relationships between data.

### In-Memory Database

It is a database that primarily stores and processes data in memory, providing fast response times and high performance.

It is used for real-time data analysis, transaction processing, caching, etc. Representative memory databases include SAP HANA and Oracle TimesTen.

## Conclusion

This is a brief look at the types of databases.

Companies utilize these various databases to efficiently store, manage, and analyze data needed for work and use them to create business value.
