## This is an article about finding sick animals (with.MySQL).

I want to solve the coding test problem, find out how to solve it differently from the retrospective of the problem I solved, and get to know.

Let's get to the problem first.

{:data-align="center"}

<!-- outline-end -->

### Problem

Please write a SQL statement that looks up the ID and name of sick animal 1 among the animals that came into the animal shelter.

At this time, please check the results in the order of ID.

Problem Description

The ANIMAL_INS table is a table that contains information about animals that have entered the animal shelter.

ANIMAL_INS table structures are as follows: ANIMAL_ID, ANIMAL_TYPE, DATETIME, INTAKE_CONDITION, NAME, SEX_UPON_INTAKE indicate the animal's ID, species, start date of protection, status, name, gender, and neutralization at the start of protection, respectively.

#### ANIMAL_INS table

<!-- #### restrictions

- The length of a is not less than 1 but not more than 1,000,000.
- a[i] means the number written on the i+1th balloon.
- All numbers of a are integers greater than or equal to -1,000,000 and less than or equal to 1,000,000,000.
- All numbers of a are different -->

<!-- #### I/O Yes -->

| NAME             | TYPE       | NULLABLE |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| ANIMAL_ID        | VARCHAR(N) | FALSE    |
| ANIMAL_TYPE      | VARCHAR(N) | FALSE    |
| DATETIME         | DATETIME   | FALSE    |
| INTAKE_CONDITION | VARCHAR(N) | FALSE    |
| NAME             | VARCHAR(N) | TRUE     |
| SEX_UPON_INTAKE  | VARCHAR(N) | FALSE    |

### problem solving

```sql
SELECT ANIMAL_ID, NAME
FROM ANIMAL_INS
WHERE INTAKE_CONDITION = "Sick"
ORDER BY ANIMAL_ID;
```

#### Solution Description

From the ANIMAL_INS table required in the problem, the IDs and names of all animals in sick condition were printed, and sorted in ascending order of IDs.
