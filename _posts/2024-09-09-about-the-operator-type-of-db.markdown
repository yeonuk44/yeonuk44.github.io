## This article examines the operator types of DB.

Hello!

The database operator represents the operations used to process and manipulate data in the database.

These operators can perform a variety of tasks, including retrieving, inserting, modifying, and deleting data.

Now let's look at the main types of database operators.

{:data-align="center"}

<!-- outline-end -->

## Select operator (SELECT)

The SELECT operator is used to retrieve the desired data from the database.

Users can select a specific column or row they want to inquire.

This allows you to extract the information you need from the database.

### Insert Operator (INSERT)

The INSERT operator is used to insert new data into the database.

You can add a new row to enter information into the database.

This allows you to store new data in the database.

### Modification Operator (UPDATE)

The UPDATE operator is used to modify existing data in the database.

You can change the value of a particular row or update the contents of the column.

This allows you to update and change the information in the database.

### Delete operator (DELETE)

The DELETE operator is used to delete specific rows or columns from the database.

It is used to remove unnecessary data or correct incorrect information.

This allows you to remove unnecessary information from the database.

### Join operator (JOIN)

The JOIN operator is used to combine two or more tables into a single set of results.

You can connect related data to perform complex queries.

There are various types of join operators, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, etc.

### aggregation operator

Aggregation operators are used to create groups of data and perform operations in groups.

Key aggregation functions include COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, etc.

This allows you to calculate statistical information by group in the database.

### Alignment operator (ORDER BY)

The ORDER BY operator is used to sort the search results in the desired order.

You can sort them in ascending order (ASC) or descending order (DESC).

This allows you to view the results in the database in the order you want them to.

### Limiting Operator (LIMIT, TOP)

The restriction operator is used to return only a certain number of rows in the search results.

It is mainly used when a large dataset requires only a fraction of data.

You can use the LIMIT or TOP keywords to limit a specific number of rows.

## at the end of the day

Database operators are utilized as important tools for processing and manipulating data.

You can utilize these operators appropriately to extract and manipulate the information you need from the database.

It is important to understand and utilize these operators well when dealing with databases.

Thank you!
