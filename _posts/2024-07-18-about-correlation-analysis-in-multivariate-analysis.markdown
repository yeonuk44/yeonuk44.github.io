## This is an article about correlation analysis in multivariate analysis.

hello!

Today we will learn about correlation analysis in multivariate analysis.

Correlation analysis is a statistical method that determines the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables, and is one of the important techniques in multivariate analysis.

We will explain correlation analysis below.

## Concept of correlation analysis

### Correlation Coefficient

It is a statistical indicator of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

Typically, the Pearson correlation coefficient is used and has a value between -1 and 1.

## Use of correlation analysis

Identify relationships between variables: Used to understand and explain the interactions and influences between variables.

### modelling

In multivariate analysis, it is used to build a model and improve predictive power by considering the correlation between variables.

### caution

#### Causal fallacy

Correlation analysis shows a relationship between two variables, but does not necessarily imply a causal relationship.

A high correlation between two variables does not necessarily mean there is a causal relationship.

### Non-linear relationship

Correlation analysis only identifies linear relationships and may not identify non-linear relationships.

### Multiple Correlation

It is a technique to analyze the correlation between three or more variables and is used to identify multivariate relationships between variables.

## Conclusion

Correlation analysis is an important technique in multivariate analysis and is used to understand and model relationships between variables.

thank you!
