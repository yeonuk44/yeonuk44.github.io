## This is an article about the types and estimation of probability distributions.

hello!

Today we will learn about the types and estimation of probability distributions.

A probability distribution is a function that provides information about the values ​​that a random variable can have and the probability that those values ​​will occur.

We will explain the types of probability distributions and their estimation below.

## Types of probability distributions

### Discrete Probability Distribution

A discrete probability distribution defines the values ​​that a discrete random variable can take and the probability that those values ​​will occur.

Representative examples include binomial distribution and Poisson distribution.

### Continuous Probability Distribution

A continuous probability distribution defines the probability that a continuous random variable falls within a certain interval.

Representative examples include normal distribution, exponential distribution, and uniform distribution.

## Estimation of probability distribution

Estimation of probability distribution refers to the process of estimating the shape or parameters of a probability distribution based on given data.

This allows you to estimate a probability distribution based on data without knowing the actual distribution.

Representative methods include the following:

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

MLE is a method of finding the parameter with which the given data has the highest probability, and is mainly used to find the parameter that best fits the given data.

### Least Squares Estimation (LSE)

LSE is a method of estimating parameters by minimizing the sum of squares of residuals (errors) between given data and a model, and is widely used in regression analysis.

### Bayesian Estimation

Bayesian estimation is a method of estimating parameters by obtaining a prior distribution and a posterior distribution based on data, and is used to deal with uncertainty probabilistically.

## Conclusion

The type and estimation of probability distributions are important factors in analyzing and modeling data and are used to effectively interpret and model data.

thank you!
