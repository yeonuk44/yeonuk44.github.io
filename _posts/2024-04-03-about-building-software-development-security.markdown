## This is an article about establishing security in software development.

hello! Let's learn about software development security.

Before starting the writing in earnest,

**---Todayâ€™s TMI---**

Today, after a good workout, I ate raw meat, salmon sushi, and rice bowl.

It was so delicious! Of course, supplement protein after exercise! lol

I do survival exercises to eat comfortably every day.

I think I can exercise regularly because I think about exercising and eating delicious food.

When you want to do something sustainable, how about applying the human psychology of reward to yourself? lol

**---TMI End---**

Coming back, in this article I will tell you about the Secure SDLC (Secure Software Development Life Cycle) methodology and the concept of secure coding.

### Overview of Secure SDLC

Secure SDLC is a methodology for developing safe software that takes security into consideration during the software development process.

The goal is to protect software from security threats by adding security elements to traditional development methodologies, and to keep users' personal information and corporate assets safe.

### Introduction to Secure SDLC methodology

Secure SDLC consists of various steps considering security.

At each stage, security factors are considered and security activities are performed.

- Requirements analysis phase: Analyze and define the security requirements of the software. Check security-related requirements, including user authentication and data encryption.
- Design phase: Design the security architecture and determine security features. We design to strengthen security by considering system vulnerabilities.
- Implementation phase: Follow security coding guidelines to prevent security vulnerabilities and write secure code. Check for use of vulnerable functions, authentication and authorization verification, etc.
- Testing phase: Perform security tests to find vulnerabilities and fix security flaws. Strengthen security through penetration testing, code review, and vulnerability scanning.
- Maintenance phase: Perform software security updates and vulnerability patches. Responses to security issues and continuous strengthening are necessary.

### Concept of secure coding

Secure coding refers to applying safe coding techniques to minimize vulnerabilities and enhance security.

Secure coding includes the following concepts:

- Input validation: Verifying the validity of user input without trusting it. Prevents vulnerabilities caused by unexpected input.
- Authentication and authority verification: Verify user identity and authority to block illegal access.
- Avoid using vulnerable functions: Using vulnerable functions may pose a security threat. Prevent vulnerabilities by using safe alternative functions or libraries.
- Data protection: Consider data encryption and safe storage methods to prevent data exposure.
- Error handling: Reduces system vulnerability by performing appropriate handling of exception situations.

## Conclusion

In this way, software development security can be strengthened through Secure SDLC and secure coding.

We must focus on protecting user and company information by developing secure software. thank you
