## This is an article about cluster analysis.

Hello!

Today, we're going to learn about cluster analysis.

Cluster Analysis is a type of unsupervised learning, which refers to a technique for grouping data with similar characteristics.

This is used to discover hidden structures within the data and to understand them by splitting them into meaningful subsets.

### the main concept

#### Cluster

A set of data with similar properties, the data in the cluster are similar to each other, and the data between clusters have different characteristics.

#### Method of measuring similarity

In cluster analysis, it is important to measure the similarity between data, so that the data can be grouped properly.

### Types of cluster analysis

#### Hierarchical clustering

It is a method of presenting the data as a hierarchical structure by grouping them sequentially or merges, which is visually represented by a dendrogram.

#### Non-hierarchical clustering

K-means clustering is a typical example of grouping data according to a predetermined number of clusters.

### Utilization

#### Customer Segmentation

It is used to divide customers into groups with similar characteristics to establish marketing strategies for each group.

#### Outlier detection

It is used to detect abnormal data.

#### Natural language processing

It is used to classify documents or words into meaningful groups.

### Evaluation

#### Intra-cluster cohesion

Evaluate the degree of aggregation by measuring the similarity between data in a cluster.

#### Variance between clusters

Evaluate the variance by measuring the distance between different clusters.

### at the end of the day

Cluster analysis is a useful method for identifying data patterns and classifying them into meaningful groups, which are actively used in various fields.

Thank you!
