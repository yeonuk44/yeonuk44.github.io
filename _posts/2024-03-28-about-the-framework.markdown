### Framework concept

A framework is a tool or environment that provides an infrastructure for software development.

Developers can use frameworks to minimize basic or repetitive tasks required when developing applications.

Frameworks help developers focus on the core logic of their applications.

### Characteristics of the framework

The framework has the following characteristics:

- Structured code: Frameworks are developed according to predefined rules and patterns to provide structured code. This allows developers to maintain a consistent code style and improve code readability and maintainability.
- Reusability: The framework provides a variety of features, allowing developers to selectively use the parts they need. Additionally, the framework includes reusable components that developers can leverage to save development time and effort.
- Extensibility: The framework has an extensible structure, allowing developers to add or modify features as needed. This allows you to flexibly respond to the needs of your application.
- Security: The framework provides various security features to help developers minimize security vulnerabilities. The framework provides functions such as security-related settings, authentication, and authorization, and developers can utilize them to develop secure applications.
- Community support: Most frameworks have active communities. Through this community, developers can share information with other developers and resolve questions or issues. Additionally, you can utilize resources such as various plugins, libraries, and documentation.

## Conclusion

Frameworks help software development proceed in an efficient and standardized manner.

Developers can utilize the framework to improve productivity, maintainability, and stability.

Therefore, frameworks are considered essential to modern software development.
