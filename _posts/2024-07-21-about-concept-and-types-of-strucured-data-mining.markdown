## Concept of structured data mining

Structured data mining primarily targets structured data such as relational databases, spreadsheets, and tabular data.

This data is organized into rows and columns, with each column containing a specific type of data.

Structured data mining is used to analyze this structured data to extract and understand useful information.

## Types of structured data mining

### Regression Analysis

It is used to analyze the correlation between variables to understand and predict the impact of one variable on another.

### Classification Analysis

It is used to classify data into predefined classes or categories and predict which category new data will fall into.

### Clustering Analysis

It is used to group data with similar characteristics to identify patterns between data and understand differences between different clusters.

### Association Rule Learning

It is used to discover relationships between items within a data set and use them to make predictions or derive rules.

### Anomaly Detection

It is used to discover unexpected events or problems by detecting and analyzing outliers that deviate from normal patterns.

## uses
