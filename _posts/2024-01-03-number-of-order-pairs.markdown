## This is the "Number of Ordered Pairs" problem.

We're going to learn about it by solving coding test problems, reflecting on the problems we solved, and exploring other ways to solve them.

Let's start with the problem.

### The problem

An ordered pair is an ordered pair of two numbers, denoted by (a, b).

Given a natural number n as a parameter, complete the solution function so that it returns the number of natural order pairs such that the product of the two numbers is n.

#### Limitations

1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000

#### Example input and output

| n   | result |
| --- | ------ |
| 20  | 6      |
| 100 | 9      |

My solution to the ### problem

```java
class Solution {
    public int solution(int n) {
        int answer = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            if(n % i == 0){
                answer++;
            }
        }
    } return answer;
}
```

#### Solution

Input: n - an integer to count the number of abbreviations.

Output: the number of weak numbers in n.

Introduction to the functions used:
n % i == 0: Checks if i is a weak number of n with the remainder operation. If the remainder is zero, then i is a weak number in n.

Possible improvements:
Improve performance: The current code checks for approximate numbers for every number, which can impact performance. To improve performance, it is sufficient to only check for the approximate number up to the square root of a given number.

Modularize your code: You can break functionality within a function into smaller modules to make your code more readable and reusable.

Mathematical optimization: Since the number of approximate numbers is a mathematically solvable problem, you can consider more efficient and concise algorithms.
