## This article examines the K-means clustering.

Hello!

Today, we're going to talk about K-Means clustering.

K-means clustering is an algorithm that groups data into K clusters with similar characteristics, a type of unsupervised learning.

We will discuss the K-means clustering below.

{:data-align="center"}

### principle of operation

#### central initialization

First, select or randomly assign K cluster centers.

#### allocation step

Assign each data to the nearest cluster center.

#### Update Steps

Update the center of each cluster to the average position of the data points in that cluster.

#### Repeat

Repeat the assignment and update steps until the cluster center remains unchanged.

### Key Features

#### Distance-based clustering

The K-means is a distance-based clustering method that performs clustering using the distance between each data point and the cluster center.

#### Selection of the number of clusters K

For the K-means, you must specify the number K of clusters. It is important to select the appropriate K value.

### Utilization

#### Customer Segmentation

It is used to divide customers into groups with similar characteristics to establish marketing strategies for each group.

#### Outlier detection

Data far from cluster centers are likely outliers and can be used to detect them.

### Precautions

#### Sensitive to outliers

Because outliers can distort the position of the cluster center, a response is needed.

#### Select an initial center

Note the initialization method, as the initial cluster-centric selection may vary the speed and results of convergence.

### at the end of the day

K-means clustering is a simple yet effective clustering algorithm that is utilized to identify the characteristics of data and classify them into meaningful groups.

Thank you!
