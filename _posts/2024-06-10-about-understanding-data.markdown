### Definition of data

Data is a factual record or information that represents facts or meaning, expressed in the form of numbers, text, or images.

Data is information expressed for processing or communication by a computer or other device.

Data is a record of events, facts, and concepts that occur in the real world and is used as an important resource in information systems.

### Type of data

- Structured data: Used in tables, spreadsheets, etc. in a structured form and stored in relational databases. Structured data has a fixed format and can be easily analyzed and processed.
- Semi-structured data: Data that is unstructured but organized according to certain rules and is expressed in formats such as XML and JSON. Semi-structured data contains some structured information and can be used for data analysis.
- Unstructured data: Data that is unstructured and does not have a certain format, such as text, images, videos, etc. Unstructured data is difficult to analyze and process, but is valuable because it contains a variety of information.

### Interaction between tacit and explicit knowledge

- Tacit knowledge: refers to internalized information such as experience, know-how, and knowledge that exists within an individual or organization. This tacit knowledge is knowledge acquired through experience and is information in an unformalized form.
- Format: This refers to information in a clear format, such as documents, reports, databases, etc. This explicit knowledge is used as a means of sharing and disseminating tacit knowledge to the outside world.

Tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge play a complementary role, and the creation and dissemination of knowledge is achieved by converting tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge and internalizing formal knowledge into tacit knowledge.

## Conclusion

Above, we briefly looked at the definition and types of data, and the interaction between tacit and explicit knowledge.

Data is recognized as an important resource in modern society, and it is important to understand and utilize it properly.

thank you!
