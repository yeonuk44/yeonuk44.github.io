## This is an article about basic probability theory.

hello!

Today we will learn about basic probability theory.

Basic probability theory is a theory that mathematically deals with the probability of occurrence of stochastic events, and is applied in various fields such as statistics, physics, economics, and engineering.

Below is information on basic probability theory.

## Definition of probability

Probability is a numerical representation of the likelihood of an event occurring and has a value between 0 and 1.

0 represents the probability that the event will not occur, and 1 represents the probability that the event will definitely occur.

### Calculation of probability

Probability is calculated as the number of possible outcomes of an event divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

This calculates the probability that an event will occur.

### Probability distribution

Probability distribution is a function that describes the probability of all values ​​that a random variable can have, and is divided into discrete probability distribution and continuous probability distribution.

### Main probability distribution

Binomial distribution, normal distribution, Poisson distribution, exponential distribution, and uniform distribution are commonly used probability distributions, and their characteristics and methods of use are being studied.

### Conditional probability

Conditional probability represents the probability of one event occurring when another event occurs, and the probability of event B occurring when event A occurs is expressed as P(B|A).

### Applications of Probability

Probability theory is applied to deal with the uncertainty that occurs when stochastic events occur, and uncertainty is predicted and used in decision-making through probability models.

## Conclusion

Basic probability theory is essential for dealing with uncertainty, and is actively researched and applied in a variety of fields.

thank you!
