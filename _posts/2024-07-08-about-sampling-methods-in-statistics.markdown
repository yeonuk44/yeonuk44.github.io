## This is an article about sampling methods in statistics.

hello!

Today we will learn about sampling methods in statistics.

In statistics, sampling refers to the process of extracting a subset of samples from a population.

This allows you to obtain information about the entire population and infer the characteristics of the population.

Below is a description of the sampling methods commonly used in statistics.

### Simple Random Sampling

This is a method of sampling in such a way that each object has an equal probability of being selected.

This ensures that each individual is selected independently and that the selected sample is unbiased.

### Systematic Sampling

This is a method of sampling at regular intervals, in which the first sample is selected at random, and then subsequent samples are selected at regular intervals.

### Stratified Sampling

This is a method of dividing the population into several strata and then randomly drawing samples from each stratum.

Samples from each layer are selected to represent the characteristics of that layer.

### Cluster Sampling

This is a method of dividing the population into several clusters, randomly selecting some clusters, and examining all individuals within those clusters.

### Resampling of measurements

A method of drawing new samples based on samples that have already been drawn, using methods such as Bootstrap and Jackknife.

## Conclusion

It is important that the sampling method selects a sample to represent the characteristics of the population.

Each method requires sampling by selecting an appropriate method depending on the specific situation or research purpose.

thank you!
