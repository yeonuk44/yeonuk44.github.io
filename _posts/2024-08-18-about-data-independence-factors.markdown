## This article examines the data independence factor.

Hello!

Database Management Systems (DBMS) are one of the core infrastructures of modern business, requiring a variety of concepts and technologies for efficient data management.

Among them, data independence is an important concept that increases the flexibility and maintenance of database systems.

In this post, we will look at what data independence is, its importance, and the elements to implement it.

## What is data independence?

Data independence means keeping the logical and physical structures of the database independent.

This allows the database system to modify the physical storage structure without changing the logical definition of the data, and conversely, to change the logical structure without changing the physical structure.

Data independence can be divided into two levels

### Logical Data Independence

Changing the logical structure (skima) of the database does not affect the application.

### Physical Data Independence

Changing the physical storage structure of the database does not affect the logical structure or application.

## The Importance of Data Independence

### Ease of maintenance

Data independence facilitates maintenance of database systems.

System administrators can manage databases more efficiently because changes in logical or physical structure can minimize the impact on applications.

### Flexible Data Management

Data independence allows database systems to respond more flexibly to changes in different requirements.

Whether new data requirements arise or existing requirements change, you can adapt without significant system-wide modifications.

### Reduce costs

Data independence helps reduce the cost of changing and scaling systems.

Low structural changes and minimal application modifications result in lower overall administrative costs.

## Elements for Implementing Data Independence

### Database Schema

A database schema is a blueprint that defines the structure and relationship of data.

Schema clearly defines the logical structure of the database, supporting logical data independence.

Database schema is typically divided into external schema (user perspective), conceptual schema (whole logical structure), and internal schema (physical storage structure).

### Database Management System (DBMS)

DBMS is a key technology that supports data independence.

Modern DBMS provides a variety of features that support logical and physical data independence.

For example, functions such as index, partitioning, and storage management are used to implement physical independence, and functions such as View and Stored Procedure are used to implement logical independence.

### Database Interface

The interface between the application and the database is an important factor in realizing data independence.

Interfaces such as Application Programming Interface (API) or Structured Query Language (SQL) allow applications to query and manipulate data without having to know the internal structure of the database.

### data abstraction

Data abstraction is another important concept that implements data independence.

Data abstraction is the representation of data in high-level logical structures, hiding physical details.

This is achieved through logical modeling of the data, enabling database users and developers to understand and use the data without worrying about the physical implementation of the data.

## at the end of the day

Data independence is an important concept that increases the flexibility and maintenance of database systems.

Logical data independence and physical data independence minimize the impact of database structure changes on applications.

For this, elements such as database schema, DBMS, database interface, and data abstraction play an important role.

A good implementation of data independence will maximize the efficiency of database systems, which will soon lead to a stronger business competitiveness.

Always be mindful of data independence in database management and actively utilize it.

Database systems will become more powerful and flexible.
