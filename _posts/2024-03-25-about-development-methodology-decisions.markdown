## This is an article about determining development methodology.

Deciding on a software development methodology is an important decision that has a significant impact on the success or failure of a project.

In this article, we will provide an overview of software development methodology decisions, the importance of project management (schedule, cost, people, risk, and quality management), and the development methodology decision process.

### Software Development Methodology Decision Overview

A software development methodology is a set of procedures and principles that developers use to develop and manage software efficiently.

The development methodology is selected based on the characteristics and requirements of the project, taking into account aspects such as schedule, cost, manpower, risk, and quality control during the development process.

Deciding on the right development methodology has a huge impact on the success and efficiency of your project.

### Project Management

Project management is the process of promoting project success by effectively managing aspects such as schedule, cost, personnel, risk, and quality.

Each element acts as an important factor directly related to the success or failure of a project.

- Schedule Management: Plan and track the project schedule to efficiently proceed with the development process. Scheduling includes setting milestones, dividing tasks, prioritizing tasks, and more.
- Cost Management: Manage costs efficiently by setting and tracking the budget for your project. Cost management includes budget allocation, cost estimation, cost control, etc.
- Manpower management: Appropriately allocate and manage the manpower needed for the project. Human resource management includes distribution of roles and responsibilities, competency assessment, and work coordination.
- Risk management: Identify and manage risks that may occur during the project. Risk management includes risk assessment, establishing risk response strategies, and risk monitoring.
- Quality Control: We perform the necessary activities to maintain and improve the quality of the software. Quality control includes setting quality standards, quality verification, and quality assurance.

### Development methodology decision process

To decide on a development methodology, you can follow the following steps:

- Requirements analysis: Analyze and document the goals and requirements of the project.
- Evaluation of candidate methodologies: Investigate various development methodologies and select the candidate methodology that best suits the characteristics and requirements of the project.
- Methodology applicability analysis: Analyze how applicable the candidate methodology is to the project and evaluate its pros and cons.
- Consider the team's capabilities and experience: Choose a methodology considering the development team's capabilities and experience.
- Develop a plan to apply the methodology: Develop a plan to apply the selected methodology to the project and consider any training or support systems needed.
- Methodology application and evaluation: Apply the selected methodology to the project and evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology during the project.

## Conclusion

Software development methodology decisions are decisions that have a significant impact on the success or failure of a project.

It is important to consider various aspects of project management to effectively manage schedule, cost, people, risk, and quality.

Additionally, when deciding on a development methodology, it is necessary to select and apply the optimal methodology by considering the characteristics and requirements of the project and the team's capabilities and experience.
