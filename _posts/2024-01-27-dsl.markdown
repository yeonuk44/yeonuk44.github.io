## What is DSL?

DSL stands for “Domain Specific Language,” meaning a language designed to solve a specific domain or problem area.

This is a language created to efficiently perform specific tasks in various fields, and unlike general-purpose programming languages, it is a purpose-specific language used only in specific domains.

### Features of DSL

- Domain specificity:
  DSLs excel in their field because they are designed to solve a specific domain or problem. This means that it has a grammar and structure optimized for a specific task.
- Expression and readability:
  DSLs emphasize readability and expressiveness in a specific domain. It is designed so that experts in the field can easily understand and use it.
- Limited scope:
  Unlike general-purpose programming languages, DSLs focus on specific tasks, so their syntax and functionality are relatively simple and clear.

### Examples of DSLs

- SQL (Structured Query Language):
  SQL is a prime example of a DSL used in database management systems. It provides a concise and clear syntax for database-related operations, allowing you to perform database queries effectively.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'USA';
```

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
  HTML can be viewed as a DSL for defining the structure of web pages. The structure of a web page is expressed in simple tags, which the web browser interprets and renders.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a sample web page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Uses of DSL

DSL is used in various fields.

In particular, it is used as a specialized language to solve problems in fields other than computer languages, allowing experts in the field to perform their work more effectively.
