### Concept of de-identification of personal information

De-identification of personal information refers to a technical process that removes or transforms information that can identify an individual to make it unidentifiable.

This ensures privacy while maintaining the usefulness of your data.

### Main technical methods

#### Anonymization

This is a method of making an individual unidentifiable by removing or encrypting the identifier so that it cannot be identified.

#### Pseudonymization

It is a technical method of replacing a direct identifier used to identify an individual with another value.

#### One-way Hashing

This is a method of encrypting data so that the original data cannot be restored.

#### Generalization

A method of removing details from data, categorizing them, and converting them into a general form.

### Necessity and Advantages

#### Enhanced personal information protection

Sensitive personal information is protected to ensure individual rights and prevent problems caused by personal information leaks.

#### Regulations and Compliance

It is an essential element for compliance with rules and regulations such as GDPR and data protection laws.

#### Maintain data availability

By de-identifying personal information, privacy can be achieved while maintaining the validity and usefulness of data.

### Limitations and precautions

#### Potential for re-identification

Please note that re-identification may be possible by persons with advanced technology and specialized knowledge.

#### De-identification error

Misused de-identification techniques may not guarantee privacy, so appropriate techniques and strategies are needed.

## Conclusion

As mentioned above, de-identification of personal information is an important technical approach to balance personal information protection and data utilization, and must be realized through appropriate technologies and strategies.

thank you!
