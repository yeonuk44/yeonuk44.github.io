# **Thymeleaf: The charm of Java-based template engines**

When developing web applications, it is important to connect client-server data and present it on-screen. In particular, in Java-based web applications, using an efficient and intuitive template engine can greatly increase productivity. **Thymeleaf** is a Java-based template engine designed to meet these needs.

## **What is Thymeleaf?**?

**Thymeleaf** is a template engine for processing HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS, and text in Java-based web applications. Known for its strong integration with the Spring Framework, it is useful for organizing dynamic web pages.  
Thymeleaf allows dynamic content to be inserted while maintaining HTML grammar, providing an easy-to-collaborate structure for designers and developers.

## ** Key features of Thymeleaf**

### 1. **Natural HTML code writing**

Thymeleaf maintains HTML grammar that displays normally when opened directly from a browser. This is called **Natural Template**, which facilitates collaboration between designers and developers.

### 2. **Complete integration with the Spring Framework**

Thymeleaf works naturally with Spring MVC and can easily transfer model data to templates. For example, data contained in 'Model' objects can be used directly in a view.

### 3. **Expression support**

Thymeleaf provides a variety of expressions to facilitate the processing of dynamic data.

- **Variable expression**: '${}'
- **Conditional expressions**: 'th:if', 'th:unless'
- **Repeated expression**: 'th:ach'

### 4. **Server-side rendering**

No additional rendering is required on the client side because the server returns an HTML page that rendered the data.

### 5. **Expandability**

Thymeleaf can extend features through plug-ins and utilities, and it can create custom dialogs to handle specific requirements.

## **Conclusion**

Thymeleaf is an intuitive and powerful template engine, which is extremely useful when creating dynamic web pages in Java-based web applications. Specifically, its natural integration with the Spring Framework increases productivity, and its HTML-friendly grammar facilitates collaboration between developers and designers.
