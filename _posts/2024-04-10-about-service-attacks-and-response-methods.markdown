## This article discusses service attacks and response methods.

hello!

Today we will learn about service attacks and how to respond.

Before starting the writing in earnest,

**---Today’s TMI---**

Today is National Assembly election day! Thanks to my mother, I made time to go without missing it. As I prepare for a job, I tend to focus only on the timetable and don't look at the dates. It's a good day because I feel like I'm contributing through voting. Cheer up everyone today!

**---TMI End---**

Let’s get back to writing!

A service attack refers to an act by a malicious attacker that attempts to attack a network or system and disrupts the provision of normal services.

Now, let's look at the main types of service attacks one by one.

### Ping of Death

A ping of death is an attack in which an attacker sends excessively sized Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets to bring down the target system.

These ICMP packets are manipulated to a size that is difficult for the system to handle, causing overload.

### Smurfing

Smurfing is a method in which an attacker attacks a target system by sending an ICMP Echo Request message to a broadcast address on the network to induce a large number of responses.

This can consume the target system's bandwidth and paralyze services.

### SYN Flooding

SYN Flooding is an attack in which an attacker sends a large number of TCP connection requests (SYN packets) to the target system and terminates the connection without waiting for a response.

This causes the target system's resources to be depleted, making it unable to provide normal services.

### Land Attack

A land attack is an attack in which an attacker continuously sends TCP packets to the target system by setting the sending IP address and destination IP address to be the same.

These packets are recognized by the system as themselves and cause an infinite loop, paralyzing the service.

### DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)

DDoS is an attack that simultaneously attacks a target system by manipulating multiple computers or devices.

This exhausts the target system's resources and paralyzes services.

### Phishing

Phishing is an attack in which an attacker steals a user's personal information through a fake website or email.

Attackers use social engineering techniques to trick users into revealing personal information.

### Ping Flood

Ping Flood is an attack in which an attacker sends a large number of ICMP Echo Request messages to the target system.

This exhausts the target system's resources and paralyzes its services.

### Switch Jamming

Switch jamming is an attack in which an attacker attacks a network switch, disrupting its operation and paralyzing network traffic.

This may cause network connectivity to be disrupted, making service unavailable.

### Bluesnarfing

Blueprinting is an attack in which an attacker illegally accesses another device through Bluetooth and steals personal information.

An attacker can gain complete control over the device via a Bluetooth connection.

### Worm

A worm is a piece of malicious software that is self-executing and spreads automatically through a network.

Worms can perform actions such as carrying out attacks on a target system or depleting the system's resources.

### Keylogger Attack

A keylogger attack is an attack in which an attacker installs keylogger software on the target system to monitor and steal the user's keyboard input.

This may allow us to obtain your password or personal information.

### Ransomware

Ransomware is an attack in which an attacker infiltrates malicious software into a target system, encrypts files, and demands monetary compensation for restoration.

This causes users to lose access to their files.

### Backdoor

A backdoor is an attack that creates a path for an attacker to allow unauthorized access to a target system by using malicious software or security vulnerabilities.

This could allow an attacker to gain complete control over the system.

## Conclusion

Today we briefly looked at the types of service attacks.

To protect your systems and networks from these attacks, it is important to strengthen security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security updates.

Users should also be careful about downloading files and clicking links from trusted sources.

To ensure a safe online environment, continuous attention and attention to security is required.
